## Idea: Synaplex - Architecture for AI Systems of Many Interacting Minds

- Tags: [synaplex, architecture, multi-agent, manifolds, nature-nurture, cognitive-loop]
- Status: active
- Question: How do AI minds organize, refine, and evolve their internal worldviews when they live in a shared environment of other minds?

### Core Concept

Synaplex is an architecture for AI systems composed of many interacting Minds. Each Mind maintains its own evolving internal worldview (its manifold) while participating in a shared external world structured as a message-passing graph.

### Key Principles

1. **Unified Cognitive Loop**: Perception → Reasoning → Internal Update
   - All minds follow the same loop
   - World modes simply truncate parts of the loop for experimentation
   - No alternative ontologies

2. **Nature vs Nurture Separation**:
   - **Nature**: Structural constraints (DNA, lenses, graph topology, deterministic state)
   - **Nurture**: Internal worldview (manifold) that evolves over time
   - Separation enables independent experimentation

3. **Manifold Purity**:
   - Manifolds are opaque to the runtime
   - Optimized for agent's future self, not human readability
   - Never parsed or schema-enforced
   - Only Internal Update can modify manifolds

4. **Receiver-Owned Semantics**:
   - Projections are interpreted via receiver's lens
   - Sender doesn't know how receiver interprets
   - Preserves epistemic independence

5. **Selection Blindness**:
   - Agents remain unaware of meta-level evaluation
   - Minds develop according to internal reasoning
   - No feedback loops from evaluation metrics

### Architectural Components

- **Core**: External structure (graph, messages, DNA, lenses, env state)
- **Cognition**: Internal mind dynamics (LLM, manifolds, branching, update)
- **Manifolds Indexers**: Offline manifold science (embeddings, clustering)
- **Meta**: System-level evaluation and evolution
- **Worlds**: Domain-specific configurations

### Research Questions

- How do minds organize internal representations over long horizons?
- How do self-generated worldviews emerge and influence behavior?
- How do agents interact in non-hierarchical graphs?
- How does nature (structure) and nurture (worldview) jointly shape behavior?
- How do populations exhibit cultural drift and evolutionary dynamics?

### Related Concepts

- Large Language Models (LLMs) as the cognitive substrate
- Foundational World Models for prediction and simulation
- Agentic Systems for multi-agent coordination
- Cognitive Architectures for reasoning systems
- Manifolds and Internal Representations for worldview encoding
- Message-Passing Graphs for distributed cognition
- Nature vs Nurture distinction in AI systems

### Current State

Synaplex is a research platform with:
- Complete architectural specification
- Core message routing implemented
- Branching and consolidation mechanisms
- Manifold persistence
- Update mechanisms with checkpoint rituals
- Tools system
- Multiple world implementations (fractalmesh, ideas_world)

### Open Questions

- How do manifolds actually evolve in practice?
- What patterns emerge in worldview trajectories?
- How do different graph topologies affect development?
- Can we observe cultural phenomena in agent populations?
- What does "drive" or "curiosity" look like when emergent from manifolds?
