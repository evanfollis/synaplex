## Idea: Synaplex "Lens Market" for Agent Attention

- Domain: ai_native_systems
- Tags: [attention, routing, incentives]
- Status: seed
- Question: How could agents bid for projection bandwidth based on lens alignment?

What if agents could express their attention preferences through lenses, and other agents could compete to provide projections that align with those preferences? This could create an emergent attention economy where valuable projections get more bandwidth.

Maybe this is too complex? But the idea of agents having some agency over what they attend to beyond simple subscriptions feels important.

## Idea: Manifold Compression for Long-Horizon Ideas

- Domain: synaplex_evolution
- Tags: [compression, manifolds, memory]
- Status: seed
- Question: How do manifolds handle very long idea trajectories without becoming unwieldy?

As ideas evolve over many ticks, manifolds will grow. Do we need explicit compression? Or does the checkpoint ritual handle this naturally? Should there be different compression strategies for different types of ideas?

## Idea: Multi-Personality Idea Exploration

- Domain: ai_native_systems
- Tags: [branching, exploration, diversity]
- Status: seed
- Question: Can we use branching strategies to explore the same idea from multiple personality perspectives?

Take a single idea, run it through explorer/skeptic/structuralist branches, then merge. Would this create richer idea manifolds? Is this different from just running multiple agents on the same idea?
