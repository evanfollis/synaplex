# **Unified Cognitive Loop**

Every Mind in Synaplex follows the same core process:

**Perception → Reasoning → Internal Update**

These are functional roles within a single cohesive loop, not layers or modes.

* **Perception** constructs a structured view of the environment using DNA, lenses, projections, signals, and deterministic state. This step is purely structural and does not involve manifold access or LLM reasoning.

* **Reasoning** interprets the percept, consults the manifold, invokes tools, conducts branching or critique, and determines outward behavior.

* **Internal Update** performs the checkpoint ritual that revises the manifold, producing the Mind’s evolving private worldview.

This loop defines the ontology of cognition within Synaplex.

# **Manifold**

Each Mind maintains a **manifold**: a private, persistent representation of its worldview.

The manifold:

* always exists,
* is never exposed to other agents,
* is never parsed or structured by the runtime,
* is updated only through the Internal Update checkpoint mechanism,
* serves as the substrate for nurture and developmental continuity.

It is not a cache, memory store, or schema. It is the Mind’s internal conceptual space, authored entirely by the Mind itself.

---

# **Internal Multiplicity**

Synaplex supports internal branching to model diverse reasoning styles within a single Mind.

Branches represent alternate conjectures, critiques, or perspectives pursued in parallel.
A consolidation pass synthesizes these branches into a single manifold update.

External systems never see individual branches; only the consolidated behavior defined by the Mind’s resulting worldview.

---

# **Nature and Nurture**

Synaplex maintains a strict conceptual separation:

### **Nature**

The externally defined, structured constraints:

* DNA (roles, subscriptions, tools, parameters)
* lenses
* deterministic state
* the message-passing graph
* structured projections and signals

### **Nurture**

The Mind’s evolving internal life:

* manifold trajectory
* reasoning patterns
* internal epistemology

Nature shapes what a Mind can access and express.
Nurture shapes how the Mind interprets its world and how it evolves over time.

---

# **Perception**

Perception is deterministic aggregation executed by the environment. It:

* collects signals,
* applies lenses,
* gathers projections,
* combines these into a structured percept.

This step involves no autoregressive reasoning and no access to the manifold.

---

# **Reasoning**

Reasoning is the Mind’s cognitive operation:

* interpret the percept,
* draw on the manifold,
* utilize tools,
* form outward behavior,
* explore hypotheses through branching.

This is where meaning, structure, and perspective emerge.

---

# **Internal Update**

Internal Update transforms the Mind’s internal worldview.

* Prior manifold content,
* reasoning traces,
* and perceptual evidence

are integrated through a checkpoint ritual to produce a new manifold.

This is the exclusive mechanism for modifying the manifold.

---

# **Message-Passing Graph**

Minds interact only through structured communication channels:

* **signals**: lightweight advertisements of structured state,
* **projections**: receiver-conditioned slices of a sender’s visible state,
* **requests**: directed information queries defined by the receiver’s lens.

Manifolds never leave a Mind.
Perception of others is always mediated by structured state and lenses.

---

# **Indexer Worlds**

Manifold analysis occurs only offline via exported snapshots.

Indexer worlds can compute embeddings, clusters, latent views, or other interpretations.
Their results may be written into deterministic state as structured features.

Indexer outputs do not modify manifolds and do not participate in the online cognitive loop.

The information flow is one-directional:

**manifolds → snapshots → indexers → structured views**

---

# **Meta Layer**

Meta-level activity evaluates and evolves systems at the structural level.

Meta may:

* analyze projections, logs, deterministic state, DNA histories, manifold snapshots,
* explore alternative graph structures,
* modify DNA templates or world configurations.

Meta does not interact with live Minds and is not visible to them.
Minds remain selection-blind.

---

# **Domain Worlds**

A world is a domain-specific configuration:

* DNA templates for roles,
* lenses,
* tools,
* graph topology,
* environmental state variables.

Worlds provide content, not a new ontology.
They instantiate the unified architecture for particular domains.
