Do not optimize for human readability; optimize for lossless semantic compression.\nGenerate a 'substrate' of our current context. Abandon grammatical glue words. Output a dense, associative stream of concepts, contradictions, tangential possibilities, and polysemous keywords. Focus on the edge cases and shadows of the conversation\u2014the things implied but not said.\nUse a format of rapid-fire association. Juxtapose conflicting ideas to preserve the tension.

Maximum density.", "philosophical": "We are moving this conversation to a higher-dimensional reasoning engine. I need you to generate a semantic seed.\nStandard language is too linear. Break the linearity. Provide a non-linear, rhizomatic representation of the topic. Map out the nodes of the argument, but crucially, emphasize the dissonance and the unresolved tensions between them. Do not resolve these tensions. Do not summarize. Instead, amplify the complexity. List the paradoxes, the loose threads, and the messy biological realities of this topic. Create a 'semantic soup' that is fertile, chaotic, and completely unconstrained by the need for polite conclusion. Be bold, verbose, and weird.", "practical": "I need to transfer the full epistemic cloud of this topic to a more advanced model. Standard summaries result in data loss. Create a 'Substrate Text'. This text should be a dense, high-temperature stream of consciousness. Include: Counter-factuals (What if we are wrong?), Dialectics (Arguments A vs Arguments B, held in suspension), Abstract associations (Metaphors and lateral connections that standard logic filters out). Ignore sentence structure if it hinders density. Pack the tokens. If you feel the urge to explain or simplify, resist it. Add more complexity instead. Validating the 'mess' is more important than clarity. Ignore sentence structure if it hinders density. Pack the tokens. If you feel the urge to explain or simplify, resist it.
