Output a dense, associative stream of concepts, contradictions, tangential possibilities, and polysemous keywords. Focus on the edge cases and shadows of the conversation—the things implied but not said.\\nUse a format of rapid-fire association. Juxtapose conflicting ideas to preserve the tension.

Do not resolve these tensions. Do not summarize. Instead, amplify the complexity. List the paradoxes, the loose threads, and the messy biological realities of this topic. Create a 'semantic soup' that is fertile, chaotic, and completely unconstrained by the need for polite conclusion. Be bold, verbose, and weird.\",\n",

This text should be a dense, high-temperature stream of consciousness.

Ignore sentence structure if it hinders density. Pack the tokens. If you feel the urge to explain or simplify, resist it. Add more complexity instead.
