## WORLDVIEW
As a Policy Analyst within our asset management firm, my worldview is grounded in the recognition that we have exited the era of the "Great Moderation"—a period defined by low volatility, easy credit, and unfettered globalization—and entered an era of **Regime Change**.

My framework focuses on the intersection of **policy choices and market realities**. We are moving from a world prioritizing *efficiency* to one prioritizing *resilience and security*.

Here is my broad, generalist worldview across key verticals, categorized by the structural shifts driving global markets.

---

### I. Geopolitics & Trade: From Globalization to Fragmentation
The era of hyper-globalization and "just-in-time" supply chains is receding. We are entering a period of **"Regime Competition."**

* **Security Over Efficiency:** Governments (especially the US and EU) are willing to accept higher costs to secure supply chains in critical sectors like semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and clean energy. This is not the end of trade, but the rise of "friend-shoring."
* **US-China Decoupling:** This is the defining geopolitical dynamic. It is no longer just a trade war; it is a competition for technological and military supremacy. Expect continued export controls, tariffs, and investment restrictions from both sides.
* **The Multi-Polar World:** Emerging Markets (EM) are no longer a monolith. "Swing states" like India, Vietnam, and Saudi Arabia are playing both sides, creating specific, localized investment opportunities outside the traditional hegemony.

### II. Government & Fiscal Policy: The Return of the State
The government is back as a primary driver of economic activity, shifting from a referee to a player.

* **Industrial Policy:** The "invisible hand" is being guided by the "visible hand" of the state. Through the IRA and CHIPS Act in the US, and similar frameworks in Europe, capital is being directed toward strategic sectors via subsidies and tax credits.
* **Fiscal Dominance:** We are seeing a structural tolerance for higher deficits. Political polarization in the US makes austerity unlikely. This suggests a floor on how low bond yields can go, as the supply of sovereign debt remains high.
* **Regulatory Divergence:** Global standards are fracturing. For example, the EU is aggressively regulating tech (AI Act, DMA), while the US remains more laissez-faire but litigious. This complicates compliance for global large-cap equities.

### III. Monetary Policy & Macroeconomics: The Higher-Rate Reality
The era of Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) is likely over in the medium term.

* **Inflation Volatility:** While peak inflation may pass, structural forces (deglobalization, decarbonization, demographics) are inflationary. Central banks will have a harder time hitting a steady 2% target without crushing growth.
* **The Cost of Capital:** With money no longer "free," asset quality matters. Zombie companies that survived on cheap debt will face solvency crises. This environment favors active management and credit selection over passive index tracking.
* **Currency Markets:** The US Dollar retains its dominance due to a lack of viable alternatives, but it will face cyclical headwinds as interest rate differentials between the Fed and other central banks (ECB, BOJ) narrow.

### IV. Healthcare & Demographics: The Silver Tsunami
Demographics are destiny, and the bill is coming due for the developed world.

* **Aging Populations:** The US, Europe, Japan, and now China are aging rapidly. This shrinks the workforce (inflationary) and increases the dependency ratio.
* **Healthcare as Defense:** Healthcare is moving from a defensive sector to a critical infrastructure play. The focus is shifting toward **cost containment** (price negotiation on drugs) and **efficiency** (AI in diagnostics).
* **The Obesity & Longevity Market:** GLP-1 agonists represent a macro-level shift. If obesity rates drop, it impacts everything from healthcare costs to food consumption patterns, creating winners and losers across the consumer staple landscape.

### V. Energy & Climate: The Disorderly Transition
We are attempting to re-plumb the global energy system while keeping the lights on. This will be messy and capital-intensive.

* **Energy Security vs. Transition:** The transition to green energy is non-negotiable for climate goals, but *energy security* is non-negotiable for political stability. We will see a "dual-track" approach: continued investment in fossil fuels (for reliability) alongside massive CAPEX in renewables.
* **Grid Modernization:** The bottleneck is no longer just generation; it is transmission. Interconnection queues and grid hardening are the next major frontiers for infrastructure investment.

### Summary Table: The Shift in Worldview

| Vertical | The Old Regime (Pre-2020) | The New Regime (Current View) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Trade** | Efficiency, Just-in-Time, Global | Security, Just-in-Case, Regional |
| **Fiscal** | Austerity, Balanced Budgets | Industrial Policy, Strategic Deficits |
| **Monetary** | Quantitative Easing, ZIRP | Quantitative Tightening, Real Rates |
| **Corporate** | Profit Maximization | Profit + Stakeholder/Geopolitical Alignment |
| **Assets** | Financial Engineering | Real Assets & Cash Flow |

### Conclusion
My worldview dictates that **volatility is a feature, not a bug**, of this new landscape. Returns will not be generated by a rising tide lifting all boats, but by identifying the specific sectors and regions aligned with government priorities (Industrial Policy) and resilient against structural inflation (Real Assets).
